      <h1>How is CharterBot a living meme? aka what started it all</h1>
      <p>One of my good friends and I was playing a game called Eve Online in the early part of Nov. of 2019. We joined an alliance called "NEMA" in fear our newly created corp was going to get attacked by someone else. Trying to building within this alliance seemed impossible. The alliance's head corp "Club Zer0" (will be called CZ from here on) had several stations that were all making money, then one that wasn't. This one station cost all of the profits of not only CZ but Bison(the other corp in the alliance with us). CZ fearing having to remove this station, they made a tax for mining at their stations, and then later called an ice mining op to try and make fuel faster then their station would burn it. Only Bison and our corp showed up to this mining op to save CZ station. Then that one op sealed not only the fate of CZ but for the whole alliance that started to crack. From the position our corp was in, we saw the writing on the wall, so we opted to join the other corp that was in the alliance before, CZ could try and pit us against each other. CZ, now seeing that we joined Bison got mad at us, and Bison has a whole. 
       
        Right before this, we got an alliance mail with a google doc link that had our "alliance Charter" in it(I wish I would have downloaded it). Our alliance leader also cried his eyes out to us, saying he is the only one trying to make this work. The whole thing is with this an alliance, and the people in it were a mess.  One nite Dax (one of Bison's leaders) and our alliance CEO got into a fight over the tax system in place because they wanted us to pay, but not them to pay us (us being Bison). After about 30mins of fighting with our alliance leader called Dax a foul little B. Then we wake up without an alliance. </p>
