      <h1>How is CharterBot a living meme? aka what started it all</h1>
      <br>
      <p>One of my good friends and I was playing a game called Eve Online in the early part of Nov. of 2019. We joined an alliance called "NEMA" in fear our newly created corp was going to get attacked by someone else. Trying to building within this alliance seemed impossible. The alliance's head corp "Club Zer0" (will be called CZ from here on) had several stations that were all making money, then one that wasn't. This one station cost all of the profits of not only CZ but Bison(the other corp in the alliance with us). CZ fearing having to remove this station, they made a tax for mining at their stations, and then later called an ice mining op to try and make fuel faster then their station would burn it. Only Bison and our corp showed up to this mining op to save CZ station. Then that one op sealed not only the fate of CZ but for the whole alliance that started to crack. From the position our corp was in, we saw the writing on the wall, so we opted to join the other corp that was in the alliance before, CZ could try and pit us against each other. CZ, now seeing that we joined Bison got mad at us, and Bison has a whole. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Right before this, we got an alliance mail with a google doc link that had our "alliance Charter" in it(I wish I would have downloaded it). Our alliance leader also cried his eyes out to us, saying he is the only one trying to make this work. The whole thing is with this an alliance, and the people in it were a mess.  One night Dax (one of Bison's leaders) and our alliance CEO got into a fight over the tax system in place because they wanted us to pay, but not them to pay us (us being Bison). After about 30mins of fighting with our alliance leader, he called Dax a foul little B. Then we wake up without an alliance. I can hear you now, yes you would think this is over now right. Well, you guessed wrong, our leader of Bison still tried to be this guys friend. Even telling us, we weren't allowed to make fun of him in our bios(I had already made a funny bio that he had gotten mad at). </p>
      <br>
      <p>NEMA broke up, and the head corp started "Zer0 Enterprises". This newly formed alliance is the same people that just kicked us out, with more alts then before. That is it, just alts they also moved their stations to alt corps to avoid being attacked by merc corps. They started to harass us (us being the members of Bison), our leader told us we weren't even allowed to talk in local. He was scared of losing his stations, so to no avail, we took this abuse like a rednecks wife. Then one day we, had effort one of the members started placing bounties on our former alliance. later that day we were wardec'ed by some Russian alliance. We learned thought spais that it was the same people just with a random Russain corp Bisons leader was in that guys dm crying about it. Well, then they both came up with this "fun war" idea. yes, you heard that right after all of that, they wanted a fun war. I still to this day have no clue what that means.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Most of Bison and I didn't join in on this fun war. I left Bison shortly after also. Then I made this meme bot to help make fun of all that has happened to my friends and me. </p>
